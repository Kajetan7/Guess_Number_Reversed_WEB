# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple web application where the player tries to guess a number between a specified minimum and maximum value. The game uses binary search to make guesses and the player provides feedback on whether the guess is too big, too small, or correct. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number.

## Usage

To use this game, download the `app.py` file and install Flask using pip. Run the `app.py` file with Python to start the game. Once the game is running, go to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to start playing. Enter a minimum and maximum number to guess between and the game will make its first guess. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too big, too small, or correct, and the game will make a new guess based on your feedback. The game will continue until you correctly guess the number.
